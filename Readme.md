## Highlights ‚ú®

- Authentication (JWT)
- CRUD for incomes and expenses
- File uploads (profile images) served from `/uploads`
- Small dashboard endpoints that aggregate recent transactions and chart data
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind + Recharts
- Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose)

## Repo structure üìÅ

- `backend/` ‚Äî Express API, MongoDB models, controllers, and uploads
  - `server.js` ‚Äî app entrypoint
  - `config/db.js` ‚Äî Mongo connection
  - `controllers/` ‚Äî auth, income, expense, dashboard logic
  - `models/` ‚Äî `User`, `Income`, `Expense`
  - `routes/` ‚Äî route definitions mounted under `/api/v1/*`
  - `uploads/` ‚Äî static files (profile images, etc.)
  - `expense_details.xlsx`, `income_details.xlsx` ‚Äî sample spreadsheets

- `frontend/expense-tracker/` ‚Äî React app (Vite)
  - `src/` ‚Äî components, pages, hooks and utilities

## Tech stack üõ†Ô∏è

- Backend: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, JWT, multer, bcryptjs, xlsx
- Frontend: React, Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, axios

## Quick start (Windows / PowerShell)

1) Clone the repo and open a terminal in the workspace root.

2) Backend

  - Install deps and start dev server (colors preserved for readability):

```powershell
cd backend; npm install; npm run dev
```

  - Production start (after setting env):

```powershell
cd backend; npm install --production; npm start
```

3) Frontend

  - Install deps and run the dev server:

```powershell
cd frontend\expense-tracker; npm install; npm run dev
```

  - Build for production:

```powershell
cd frontend\expense-tracker; npm run build
```

## Environment variables (backend) üîë

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` with the following (example):

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/expense-tracker
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
PORT=5000
```

Notes:
- `CLIENT_URL` is used by CORS middleware. Set it to your frontend dev URL (Vite default is `http://localhost:5173`).
- JWT tokens issued by the backend expire in 1 hour by default.

## API overview üîç

Base URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`

- Auth
  - `POST /auth/register` ‚Äî register user (returns token)
  - `POST /auth/login` ‚Äî login (returns token)
  - `GET /auth/me` ‚Äî get user info (protected)

- Income
  - Standard CRUD routes under `/income` (protected)

- Expense
  - Standard CRUD routes under `/expense` (protected)

- Dashboard
  - Aggregation endpoints under `/dashboard` for charts and recent transactions (protected)

Uploads are served statically at `/uploads` (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/uploads/<filename>`).

Refer to the backend `routes/` and `controllers/` for full endpoint details and request/response shapes.

## Useful developer notes

- Database: the project uses Mongoose models located in `backend/models`.
- Passwords are hashed (bcryptjs) on the User model; login uses a compare helper.
- Multer handles image uploads; uploaded files land in `backend/uploads` and are exposed via express.static.
- There are sample Excel files in `backend/` (`expense_details.xlsx` and `income_details.xlsx`) ‚Äî the backend includes `xlsx` dependency if you want to import/export.

## Running locally ‚Äî checklist

1. MongoDB running locally or a remote URI set in `MONGO_URI`.
2. `.env` created in `backend/` with required vars.
3. Start backend, then frontend.

## Tests

There are no automated tests included. Adding unit/integration tests (Jest + Supertest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend) is a recommended next step.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Open an issue to discuss features or bug fixes. Keep PRs small and focused.

If you'd like, I can also:
- add a short API reference (example requests + sample responses),
- add a Postman/Insomnia collection,
- or create a minimal `docker-compose` for Mongo + backend + frontend.
